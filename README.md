# File-Zipping
File Zipping is about constructing a Huffman Tree using a data set consisting of all the symbols in text file and using this tree to compress any text file there by avoiding to constructing a Huffman Tree every time any file is to be compressed there by reducing the time complexity of the algorithm.
# Absract
Most of the applications need storage of large volumes of data. And these large volumes of data require a lot of storage. Compressing data reduces the amount of data need to be stored and there by reducing storage costs. This project aims toward the implementation of Huffman encoding algorithm to a data set and reusing the same Huffman coding tree for the compression of similar files. Thereby we can improve the speed of compression, reduce the complexity of the algorithm and reduce the header length that is need to transmit the Huffman coding tree.
# Note
This application may run a bit slow because of the method used for reading the contents of the file. But this can be made faster by using parallel processing methods but that's not what excatly concentrated here.
